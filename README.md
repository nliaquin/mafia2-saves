# mafia2-saves
I'm using github to store my Mafia 2 (Classic Edition) savegames now. Feel free to take these saves. You must match the DLC I have enabled: Jimmy's Vendetta, The Betrayal of Jimmy, Joe's Adventures, and disable the rest because this save won't work.

### Save Locations
You should clone this git repository in the specific place the game executable will expect it to be in.

On Windows, it would be %LOCALAPPDATA%\2K Games\Mafia II\Saves\
On Linux with SteamPlay, 
```
/home/enoch/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/50130/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/2K Games/Mafia II/
```

This only recently became complicated, as it used to be more straightforward until the devs felt the need to update a 10+ year old game, just to remove some music and change the save file location.
